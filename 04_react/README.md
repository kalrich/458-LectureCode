# Working with React

These sandboxes require the use of NPM to run a local development server, since React and styled-components dependencies need to be compiled by Babel before the browser can render the code.

Follow these steps to run the sandboxes:

1. Download and install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download) (or verify you have a current installation)

2. Within the directory containing the sandbox, run the following command to install all packages specified in `package.json`

```
npm i --force
```

Note: Dependency versions can become outdated and may need to be changed at some point to ensure forward compatibility.

3. Within the directory containing the sandbox, run the following command to start the development server. This should open up your code in a default browser, but if not you can navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` in your broswer of choice to see the rendered code.

```
npm start
```
