        A few days ago, on the way home from school, my nine year old son told
        me he couldn't wait to get home to write more of the story he was
        working on. This made me as happy as anything I've heard him say — not
        just because he was excited about his story, but because he'd discovered
        this way of working. Working on a project of your own is as different
        from ordinary work as skating is from walking. It's more fun, but also
        much more productive.
      </p>
      <p>
        What proportion of great work has been done by people who were skating
        in this sense? If not all of it, certainly a lot.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is something special about working on a project of your own. I
        wouldn't say exactly that you're happier. A better word would be
        excited, or engaged. You're happy when things are going well, but often
        they aren't. When I'm writing an essay, most of the time I'm worried and
        puzzled: worried that the essay will turn out badly, and puzzled because
        I'm groping for some idea that I can't see clearly enough. Will I be
        able to pin it down with words? In the end I usually can, if I take long
        enough, but I'm never sure; the first few attempts often fail.
      </p>
      <p>
        You have moments of happiness when things work out, but they don't last
        long, because then you're on to the next problem. So why do it at all?
        Because to the kind of people who like working this way, nothing else
        feels as right. You feel as if you're an animal in its natural habitat,
        doing what you were meant to do — not always happy, maybe, but awake and
        alive.

        Many kids experience the excitement of working on projects of their own.
        The hard part is making this converge with the work you do as an adult.
        And our customs make it harder. We treat "playing" and "hobbies" as
        qualitatively different from "work". It's not clear to a kid building a
        treehouse that there's a direct (though long) route from that to
        architecture or engineering. And instead of pointing out the route, we
        conceal it, by implicitly treating the stuff kids do as different from
        real work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead of telling kids that their treehouses could be on the path to
        the work they do as adults, we tell them the path goes through school.
        And unfortunately schoolwork tends be very different from working on
        projects of one's own. It's usually neither a project, nor one's own. So
        as school gets more serious, working on projects of one's own is
        something that survives, if at all, as a thin thread off to the side.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's a bit sad to think of all the high school kids turning their backs
        on building treehouses and sitting in class dutifully learning about
        Darwin or Newton to pass some exam, when the work that made Darwin and
        Newton famous was actually closer in spirit to building treehouses than
        studying for exams.
      </p>
      <p>
        If I had to choose between my kids getting good grades and working on
        ambitious projects of their own, I'd pick the projects. And not because
        I'm an indulgent parent, but because I've been on the other end and I
        know which has more predictive value. When I was picking startups for Y
        Combinator, I didn't care about applicants' grades. But if they'd worked
        on projects of their own, I wanted to hear all about those. we have to
        redesign it (though I'm not saying we don't), just that we should
        understand what it does to our attitudes to work — that it steers us
        toward the dutiful plodding kind of work, often using competition as
        bait, and away from skating.
